# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Jeremy Nava and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Engineering.

### CPSC 120

* [Lab 3](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-03-jeremyn-123)

    Lab 3, part 2 was really interesting because of the unit conversion. I like how you can input a milliliters in the metric system and the program does the math and converts it to the customary system (teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups). I know we have created way more advanced things throughout this course but this excited me because I actually created the program.

* [Lab 9](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-09-daniel_and_jason_jeremy).

    Lab 9, part 1 was really challenging and the most interesting for me. We could not figure out how to calculate the math for this part of the lab. But eventually figured it out and it felt so good and rewarding because we actually figured it out by ourselves and made me want to learn more. It really showed me how great working in a team is.

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-11-matthew-and-jaremy).

    Lab 11, part 2 was really fun. I really enjoy making small games and Hi-Lo Game was very fun to make. We made another Hi-Lo game in a previous lab but that one was very simple and a bit boring. I really enjoyed this one because it was actually fun to create and a lot more interactive with the user.
